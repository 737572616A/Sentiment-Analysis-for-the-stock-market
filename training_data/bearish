this can go back to 5.5 area easily on monday or even worse IMHO
I don't think anyone's gonna hold this over the weekend
If there is no news over the weekend, this will open below 6. Just saying Bearish
Classic buyout pump and dump
doesn't look to be slowing down
should get continued downward push towards eod and possibly panic selling around 6.5 from buyers at 7 today.
Fading start? ouch
and she left the building.
And if they don't find a buyer soon, this goes back to 6.
I can't find that...rabish 
Careful, High risk
This is typical pump and dump
after a parabolic run, instead of cashing out the gains?
pop is one thing, will gains hold>??? really u think so? ok just watch,$EOPN everythin goes up, they dont come down again, right?. LOL:-)
After Hour stocks fall back 
Bearish Signal Idication.

expect more downgrade
It's just a matter of time before this sinks.
Pump & dump. 
Short it to zero
scam company. Cheated home owners. Will be out of business in Cali
this is going to Zero
dumping to new lows
well there's the new low of day
It's going to go down fast.
Slight pull back and then...plop!
Going right back down
do not touch this thing, going to 0!
It's no going up again that's a given
you can do it baby!
At the exact time of big drop. 
Pump and dump? 
No benefit at all
Rode her up and ready to ride her down!
Destruction ahead. Sell short.
crack

awful
SHORT IT!!!!!!!!!!!
building a short position in this seems to be a no brainer
just shorted the shit out of this 
volume crush after earning 
you know this price action is not retail buyers
IS NOT overbought, you will lose big time if you short  based on your faulty daily charts
Bear market rallies are strong!
is Not breaking out yet! 
I wouldn't fight the trend here. Just dumb.
just had 13/34 ema neg cross & all 3 MACDs now negative 
Futures down
A close over 400 tomorrow invalidates rounding top.
Did markets try to shrug off ALL that bad news today?
Seemed like CNBC tried to steam roll through today.
done did short $QQQ here.
when momentum fails
new lows coming
Currently sitting on a do or die level
not sure it can give too many more before it's too late for long positions..
Trying to hold onto the weekly bottom bolly, 177 still the target of this breakdown
Financials and Energy are falling
won't be long before the market collapses, watchout
Feels very difficult to be short this week
I think that trend won't hold this time- net bearish/short equities,
Reverse dips will be the new pattern in the near future
Looks like someone's pushing for religions to clash.
looking for more downside targets
sell sell sell
Flirting with LOD... not good
Warning signs are everywhere! Crash Coming!
shorting $QQQ above $100
This market is rigged
Not going to play this game.
Anyone else think the aftermath about to come from all these central banks cutting rates and scrambling?
close today below 102.10 and a gap up and fail tomorrow could be the start of a big slide.
Bear market bounces just set up the next leg lower .
They warned all week of whats to come. Can only blame yourself for being in the market this week.
following the entire market downfall currently. Nothing to be afraid of.
Running out of steam. Going down big time today.
Will short at 9 .
I say this timbers down to 7.50s area soon.
No near term catalyst to keep this moving.
an offering followed by multiple insiders selling.... fear this jump is a bull trap .
has broken to the downside so would be careful w/ bull position and add to short.
Handful of leading growth stocks could run into earnings, the rest too wild & loose to trade.
nearing lows of the day ahead of market. Short trading ideas following though.
did after reverse split .
New loooows .
monthly chart overbot, rising wedge and neggie d indicating multi-year top likely
This may drop a lot more! Get ready!
still weak.
Hourly chart broke the rising wedge, retested and failed today, lower prices imo.
chart downside range to watch in Bonds through opex, $5 air pocket down to gap supp $SP.
wait until they make it loser as well.
The will prob dump $GLD  the end of the day #fluff Totally
Wont be surprised if $GLD fell to the 1260s...tomorrow

Short is the trade for oil, natural gas, gold, stock markets at large.
where are the bears?
Bear market rallies are strong!
Last 2 times this negative Gold peaked & went to new low
Right now channel down perform to target level at gartley at 41.70,
 A Bearish Chill.
 More bearishness there.
I am already short (again) $EEM after it failed on a retest of 50DMA resistance.
 I plan to close out my $TUR position here.
200DMA breakdown and downtrend is still very much alive though.
 Falling knife ...
down 3% on outrage over Deputy PM Comments .
tries to establish an uptrend below 2 mighty downtrends, which are supported by bad politics. So upside limited and short lived .
Not gonna help much.
No trend change.
But ETF so low, that's maybe simply too low.
couldn't impress the markets, because they can't kep it that high.
New all-time lows relative to S&Ps .
short $TUR again and again...
 Turkish Stock Market is about to crash.
Here are the 5 worst ETFs in the world...
hard to believe this is done falling, even with the bounce today..
The trouble in Turkey $TUR continues today, the ETF is down 5%, now nearly 20% loss in last 1mo.
shorts can hit next week since its acting so weak since open
IS A JOKE IT IS THE BEST AT ONE THING, NEVER MAKING ANY MONEY!! THIS THING HAS LOST MONEY SINCE DAY ONE LOL WASTE OF A STOCK TICKER
Nice to see it deflating again 
short
Why's it dropping
ugly quarterly loss, so much for that pump and dump attempt
massive $5 million loss how much longer will this SCAM be able to keep paying for their daily pump promos? #short the Ask hard
bigger bottom line loss bigger cash burn... another pump and dump bites the dust
 they're pumping all the garbage today..this market is pretty much a joke
short the Ask hard on these terrible pump & dumps and let the chasers hold the bag 
quarterly PUMP and DUMP
another insider PUMP and DUMP attempt
short it hard 
going to zero, fired all employees today

This seems like a losing battle folks

Russia is not going to accept

out of russ with ten cent loss
Typical pump and dump

It looks like a weak price support
Stock Breakouts FAIL
Bearish is an indication
peace unlikely.
wouldn't want to be hold
you won't get another dividend
 heading down until equalization occurs.
steping down
looks overpriced 
losing orders
 short heavy 
Discover the issues
the company should be hoarding cash is bad management. 
Game over
The worst is yet to come
Heavy block selling 
no buying
 Stock  Collapses 
down regardless of downgrade
Fantasy over; back to reality
on the way down. 
enormous red flag right now
premature and too risky now
down your throats. this is easy
What a loser
Fading
it is still a bearish chart. 
Price action looks
You guys are going down !
Should I take my prof in walk?
Haters going to hate

 just profiting off the jumps
that, is why you never hold these overnight.
uncontrollable losses
Holding my reg short position.

You are missing out on the ride to the bottom
It was a low volume pump for several days, not even 2m volume daily. Only one green 10m candle in the last 2 hours
Still too early to cover, just made a new low.
has continued to make new lows for the day. Spikes in the price caused mainly by short covering
Midday low volume manipulation, the real drops have yet to come
How low will this fall today? That is the question...
Congrats to all shorts!!
Freefall
could go down 20+% today
this run was ridiculous and way overextended.
 broke previous day low, more downside to come
run is over
Break below yesterday's low of $34.28 will trigger more dumps
holders will start dumping hardcore, there is no more buying support left
beaware buyers, big boys carefully trapping the buyers here, they will hand theirs to u carefully in controlled fashion, falling more
look at the volume, just with 200k traded, its down almost 10%, shows no support on the buy side, may free fall more n its friday too
waiting for break below $35
flush
will cover in the low 30s
Still shorting from 39.30
This should crash down hard to 34s soon
and here comes the gap down.Hype is gone it is time to get out
This has dump written all over it. Average 39.13
one final push up before the dump, very bearish
 low floating pump and dump like $LAKE $DGLY all went new high now all testing new low. No POS
red by 3pmish n 35 by eod? Seems like it. Should be atleast 10% or more down next couple days
We will flush on the next attempt.
reds a coming
there we go... the dump.
37 will flush. just give it time
 Now the dump!!!!!
will be red soon...easy short still
 good short here, adding more to my short position
should correct 10-20% to downside rather easily
this may go down hard once it starts to reverse, very risky here for buying, may be a good short if it gets to lower
this has dump written all over it
People hold this at much higher levels. My feeling is that if this rally fails They rush out
I am short but I have learned that anything can happen.
There will be no "rally" this pig will be in 6's in a couple hours
Hold ur gains n look for re-entry... Don't be greedy guys
This will go down hard .. Take ur profit yesterday was a big move..
The tanking has started PM lol
Tanking premarket and will probably be down even worse as stops get taken out and people take profits
It will go down hard in morning...
IS GOING TO SHOOT BACK DOWN TO EARTH QUICKLY TODAY!!!!
no brainer.. would go up a little at market open then will dip down
a little overdone here
Danger Zone stocks pick for short Tomorrow cover target $6.40

 Tomorrow it'll be the bulls suffering from a severe case of $ANGINA. Hmm, I like your pun more
Garbage just day trader play Penny stocks play

$ANGI is Pure Trash and Garbge stocks
Fade into close and/or big drop tomorrow...looking to cover under $7 this week.
just hit it again! probably done now... will sit back and watch it fall now..no time frame, but it will
I have to say that although I am short ANGI sure is trying
short at will
I cannot borrow shares. You know any other brokers..
Funny how Bulls gone n bear in full control .. Still I am bearish..
Pretty weak close
short covering......will have to let it work
Dont catch a falling knife"
looking bad....short here
drying like paint?!??!?! Which way is she going?
SHORT SHORT SHORT to 6.00
Target reduced to $7.25. That what I yesterday too
we will see though, that bounce just looks like short covering to me, may bounce off its 50MA tomorrow
looking for an exit but not really getting a reason to, stop placed at $7.2 and was easy to see it would bounce at 7.07 like I said
Every time I think about exiting my short, I realize this company is crap...holding short
This will fall back to $5 range in no time, Great short opportunity here. As always everyone will realize their business model is S
 it's going down and down and down
below 7.20 and this will flush
time to test low of day
The more comfortable Joe the Plumber gets with his Yelp account, the less valuable Angie's becomes
Did not see the 7.50 mark coming
